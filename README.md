This repository explores various noise reduction techniques for audio processing, providing implementations and comparisons of popular methods. The included techniques cover a spectrum of approaches, from adaptive methods like Normalized LMS filter and Wiener Filter to spectral gating techniques such as Conservative Spectral Gating. The repository also delves into advanced methods like the application of Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and wavelet-based algorithms. Additionally, the SpeechBrain library is leveraged for sophisticated denoising. The provided implementations aim to enhance audio quality by effectively reducing unwanted noise, catering to diverse use cases.

Noise Reduction Techniques:
Adaptive Noise Reduction:

Utilizes adaptive filtering to dynamically reduce noise based on the characteristics of the input signal.
Conservative Spectral Gating:

Implements a spectral gating approach, conservatively reducing noise while preserving signal integrity.
Wavelet-based Algorithm:

Applies wavelet transformations for noise reduction, leveraging the multiresolution analysis properties of wavelets.
Normalized LMS Filter:

Implements a normalized Least Mean Squares (LMS) filter for adaptive noise reduction.
Wiener Filter:

Utilizes the Wiener filter, an adaptive filter to enhance signal quality by reducing unwanted noise.
Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT):

Applies the Short-Time Fourier Transform for time-frequency analysis and noise reduction.
Root Mean Square (RMS) Level:

Uses RMS level analysis for noise reduction by thresholding amplitude levels.
SpeechBrain:

Integrates the SpeechBrain library, a comprehensive toolkit for speech processing tasks, for advanced denoising.
